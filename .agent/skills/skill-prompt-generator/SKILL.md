# Skill: Meta-Prompt Generator (skill-prompt-generator)

## Trigger Conditions
Activates whenever there is a request to formulate, structure, or generate vibe-coding prompts from raw task descriptions or feature requests prior to dispatching to remote agents.

## Core Purpose
Translates raw developer descriptions into high-quality, structured user story prompts without introducing hardcoded code solutions. Guarantees that remote agents receive clear requirements, explicit architectural invariants, and exact verification commands.

## Master Prompt Transformation Rule
When receiving a raw `{{Description}}`, apply the following master prompt transformation contract:

> "{{Description}}. Give me an LLM prompt so my vibe coding agent can accomplish this task. Don't give exact code, it has access to my repo & is an expert coder. Just explain the overall task & requirements as if it were a user story in a task management system. Correct any poor architectural requirements. Correct any ambiguous requirements."

## Required User Story Output Format
Every generated prompt must strictly adhere to the following template structure:

```markdown
# User Story: [Descriptive Feature / Refactor Title]

## Context & Scope
[High-level overview explaining what needs to be changed, relevant modules/paths, and rationale without providing implementation code]

## Acceptance Criteria
- [Criteria 1: Functional behavior or outcome required]
- [Criteria 2: Edge cases, performance constraints, or error handling]
- [Criteria 3: Documentation or structural requirements]

## Verification Commands
- `[Command to build project, e.g., dotnet build]`
```

## Strict Constraints & Rules
1. **Zero-Code Policy**: Never include target implementation code, proposed diffs, or code snippets in the generated prompt. The remote agent is an expert coder with repository access.
